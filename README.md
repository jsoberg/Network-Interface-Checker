# Network-Interface-Checker

Simple Kotlin application that displays the currently available network interfaces on your machine.

An executable jar can be built by running the `shadowJar` command. Running the jar will show a list of available network
interfaces, in the form:

```sh
wlan0    Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6E
eth0     Bluetooth Device
<name>   <display name>
```
